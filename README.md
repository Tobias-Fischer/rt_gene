# Overview + Accompanying Dataset
The code is split into three parts, each having its own README contained. There is also an accompanying [dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/2529036) [(alternative link)](https://goo.gl/tfUaDm) to the code. For more information, other datasets and more open-source software please visit the Personal Robotic Lab's website: <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/personal-robotics/software/>.

## rt_gene (ROS package)
The `rt_gene` directory contains a ROS package for real-time eye gaze estimation. This contains all the code required at inference time.

## rt_gene (Standalone)
The `rt_gene_standalone` directory contains instructions for eye gaze estimation given a set of images. It relies on the `rt_gene` package (above).

## rt_gene_inpainting
The `rt_gene_inpainting` directory contains code to inpaint the region covered by the eyetracking glasses.

## rt_gene_model_training
The `rt_gene_model_training` directory allows using the inpainted images to train a deep neural network for eye gaze estimation.
